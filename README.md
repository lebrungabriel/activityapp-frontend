# ActivityApp Frontend

ActivityApp Frontend is the client-side component of the ActivityApp web application. It is built using Next.js and React, and utilizes TypeScript for static typing, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Chakra UI for UI components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the frontend locally, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com)

### Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/your-username/ActivityApp-frontend.git
cd ActivityApp-frontend

Install dependencies: yarn install

### Configuration

The frontend does not require specific configuration, as it communicates with the backend API running on port 3000 by default.

If your backend is running on a different port, you can update the API base URL in the src/api/index.ts file.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run the frontend locally, use the following command: yarn dev

The frontend will run on port 3001 by default. You can change the port by updating the next.config.js file.
